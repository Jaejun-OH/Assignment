        <dd>- A guitar practice is one of my favoruite hobby. First learnt when I was in a primary school, then lost interest for couple of years. However, now it has been around 4 years since I grabbed my guitar again.
            It is helpful to control my emotion whenever I feel either happy or blue. </dd>

  <h2>Interest in IT </h2>
    <ul class = "IT_Text">
      <li><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? </b></li>
        <p>-	My interest in IT developed from when I first investigated the potentials of artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional ai based software which are mainly purposed to perform repetitive tasks, an intelligence that can interpret and manipulate the task without any human intervention was very fresh for me. However, the core knowledge of the mechanism behind ai was beyond my capability of understanding and suddenly became too much overwhelming. Consequently, my interest shifted to application of ai in a way of making a better life. </p>
      <li><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></li>
        <p>-	My uncle inspired me with a lot of technical ideas of implementing IT in real life. He has already developed an English learning application as well as an intranet server to safely deliver study materials to students internally. Not only just the way he developed his own application, his challenge towards unknown was a remarkable lesson for me. Considering that IT was still a vague subject for an average people about a decade ago, seeing someone who can actually accomplish and produce something practical in use was more than enough to trigger my interest in IT.</p>
      <li><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b></li>
        <p>-	After completing year 12 in Tasmania, deciding for my next Uni pathway took a long time because I had to consider so many aspects before enrolling. Especially, due to the pandemic, studying on campus seem to be impossible. Instead, I started to seek for an alternative Uni options via OUA. For a student seeking for a bachelor degree, OUA introduced a bachelor course of Information Technology from RMIT university. It seemed to be the best option available because the course suited my interest and the course was structed fully online. Besides, the reputation of RMIT was already well known which it was also an important factor to consider. Therefore, I decided to start my Uni life with RMIT.</p>
      <li><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </b></li>
        <p>-	I hope my study in RMIT can provide a new pathway for my IT career. I expect myself to be more proficient in a various IT expertise. Among many other important skills, I think programming is one of the key fundamental skills in IT. Without being able to use an appropriate language, I would easily meet limitations in later careers. Moreover, I hope my understanding of a current IT field could further expand. I want be able to draw a big picture of how IT field is impacting our society and how it will develop. Lastly, my interest in artificial intelligence would like to be broaden from theoretical to practical aspects. </p>

    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51770212?type=standout#searchRequestToken=18122e13-689c-42da-bd19-306fc8358e96">Link to the website</a>
      <ul class="IJ_Text">
        <li>
          The job is called a junior data analyst offered by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia. I will be mainly assigned to a job related to database analysis, interpretation and visualisation. The job should always be headed towards improvement opportunities made up of high accuracy and consistency. Flexible working strategy might be required in such data observations.  I think this job is appealing because RAC is a trusted brand with a history for over a century. Furthermore, it offers an opportunity for a training and development in related fields.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          The job itself does not require a high technical standard as it is offered for a junior staff.
          However, they still expect employees to be experienced in SQL, R, SAS, Excel, Business Intelligence reporting and visualisation tools.
          Moreover, employees suppose to have completed any tertiary qualifications in quantitative studies.
          Lastly, employees should be enthusiastic and passionate towards problem solving with making better improvements for RAC members.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          Currently I have not yet completed any tertiary education. As a first-year university student, my experience in IT business is still insufficient. I only have a minor understanding on computing and database using MySQL. Several coding language experience might benefit in learning a new software language required for the job such as SQL, R, and SAS. However, my dedication towards the job will be truthful without doubt.
        </li></br>
        <li>
          I will have to successfully accomplish the bachelor of IT from RMIT in order to get a tertiary qualification. Once my certificate is obtained, it would be easier for me to find the first level of IT support jobs to gain experience in relation to business reporting, Excel, and team work.  Level two IT support jobs may also be an option if I can get a better training in technical supports especially in database and interpretation.

        <li><b> What do the results of these tests mean for you</b></li>
          <p>
            The results of these tests were interesting to visualise and analyse my personality traits. There were some similar personality results across the different tests as well as some contrasting results. The big five personality test and the Myers-Briggs personality test indicate that I enjoy meeting and creating connections with others. At the same time, I am slightly introverted in which occasionally I need my own time to recover but its usually a time for a self-analysis. My type of  personality tends to be sensitive to others and passionate towards excitement and interest. On the other hand, my personality often easily gets stressed with criticisms. While kind warm advises could accelerate my passion, bitter comments could end up in a destructive way. According to my learning style test, I learn slightly better in visual methods but auditory learning also shows its significance in my way of learning. I think most of the personality test results are acceptable compared to my real personality.  However, I doubt that my personality could vary depending on my daily mood and such events of life. Therefore, personality tests could be beneficial to get an overview of someone before an actual meeting. Nonetheless, the results are not always absolutely reliable.
          </p>
        <li><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></li>
          <p>
            The results may influence my behaviour in a team.  Big five personality traits test results can assume how likely I would behave in a group situation.  The high scoring in Extraversion tend to show activeness, social, and talkative behaviours of an individual. It is expected to enjoy group situation. Therefore, an interactive group works may suit my personality. High scoring in agreeableness reflects the loyalty and honesty towards their group as well as cooperativeness and friendliness within the group.  My final strength is neuroticism; also know as emotional stability. It indicates the ability to manage emotional status. In a workplace environment, it is commonly related to high consistency in a work commitment. In contrast, my low scoring in openness and conscientiousness could result in shortcomings such as unorganised, inefficient planning, lack of creativity, and personal curiosity. In conclusion, according to my test results, I would better behave in a team if I can promote social and individual interactions and show consistency. Nevertheless, improvements in self-management and showing recognition of common interests will enhance my group behaviour (Monihar 2020)<sup>1</sup>.
          </p>
        <li><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></li>
          <p>
            A personality can be an important factor when forming an effective team.  A research conducted by Hoffman, L. R., and Maier, N. R. F. in 1961 suggest that forming a team with a variety of personality traits happens to be more effective rather than comprising a team with similar personality traits. Apparently, an abundance in a same or similar personality traits, seems to show great strength in a certain job but they often lack of cooperation and struggle with weaknesses. For example, a  team with a majority of conscientious individuals will likely perform a remarkable success on their tasks but their perfectionism and seriousness towards their job will hinder their work pace and the effectiveness will drop.  Therefore, according to my personality tests, a couple of individuals with a surprising ideas and creativity will be highly beneficial. Furthermore, a number of extraverted and conscientious individuals will also be very supportive in a way of cooperating within a team (Harper 2018)<sup>2</sup>.

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <p class="PI_Text">
      <p1>
        The application proposed for the project is an interactive guitar tablature. It will service a variety of features mainly targeting beginners and intermediate guitar players. A guitar has a special musical note called a tablature that directly instructs the exact line and the exact fret to pick. It is a way more effective learning method than following the traditional musical notes or memorising every single code shape of a guitar. The application is expected to have a great potential when it comes to a further development as a great musician’s tool for any amateur musicians. However, some potential copyright and publication issues must be resolved.
      </p1></br></br>
      <p2>
        From my experience, learning a guitar is often a series of boring and repetitive work that requires a lot of patience to reach a certain level. The joy comes from whenever being able to perform favourite songs, thus tablatures are key to assist them. Beginner guitar players usually struggle to follow tablatures and takes time to get familiar. Rather than just iterating endlessly, an interactive guitar tablature can reduce the repetition by increasing the effectiveness. Current guitar applications do provide such features however, they are often expensive and most tablatures are only available via user uploads.
      </p2></br></br>
      <p3>The interactive guitar tablature application can be developed in both PC apps and mobile apps. Thus, user can decide which platform to choose based on their main use of various functions. For example, mobile tablature application could implement a guitar tuner to allow user to simply tune their instrument as well as alternate tunings. On the other hand, PC tablature apps will provide a better experience in tab viewers and writing own tabs. </p3></br></br>
      <p4>The fundamental key features are mainly designed to support beginners and intermediate players. In the purpose of encouraging absolute beginners to enjoy learning tablature and playing the instrument, quick and short reading instructions will be a great initiation for them. Once the user grasps the concept of tablatures, they can travel around the application to learn basic guitar skills or practice their techniques. </p4></br></br>
      <p5>Since many beginners tend to struggle with correctly positioning their fingers on a certain location, a simple interactive tab exercises will be viable. Obviously, tab exercises would require scoring as well as checking correctness to be more playable like a game. In addition, some very simple but popular songs could be stored and given as a sample, so the players could experience the satisfaction of learning new songs from the beginning till the end.  Despite that precise finger peeking is a time-consuming work, it is expected to improve significantly from the moment where players become able to play whatever song they prefer or like. This is where players move on to the intermediate’s level.</p5></br></br>
      <p6>The intermediate’s level features intend to promote players to attempt many songs and naturally acquire skills and techniques. Therefore, the interactive tablature viewer can be a useful tool for them. Most current tablature viewers can only search for tabs from user uploads. This often comes with the limitation where user cannot find tabs for their songs especially for unpopular songs. As a solution, the application will support pdf uploads. Most guitar tablatures are written by a program called Guitar Pro in .gp5 format and they could be exported in either .gp5 or .pdf. Which later on, .gp5 formats are usually uploaded to a tablature app and .pdf formats are sold as a downloadable tab note. Therefore, the user could maximise the efficiency of tab notes by making it interactable rather than just playing through a plain pdf copy. </p6></br></br>
      <p7>After when tablature is uploaded to the application, user can choose whether they would play interactively or by themselves. An interactive play would dictate the sound and check the correctness of the play. Moreover, auto-scrolling as well as tempo customisation features seem to be ideal for a better convenience in practice.   </p7></br></br>
      <p8>When the user is interested in learning in-depth harmonics, a chromatic scale exercise can be a good introduction. It may be unnecessary for just a casual guitar player but it becomes essential when it comes to the expert’s level. Alongside with chromatic scale exercises, the final feature of the app would be writing own tablatures. This would allow users to write their own guitar songs or to create a cover tab notes.</p8></br></br>
      <p9>The application will require several open-source software. Firstly, tablature rendering software should be implemented in to a program. While many available rendering software are mainly web-based using JavaScript, a library called alphaTab seem to be ideal. It is a library for a JavaScript and .net Framework to render musical notes to build a software (bukaznik 2018)<sup>1</sup>. This seems ideal because it supports file importing, note rendering, and audio engines which are all necessary components in creating a software. When implementing alphaTab library, the program has to be built by using .net Framework. Furthermore, the tuning feature will require a sound analysis library to calculate the frequency of the pitch. </p9></br></br>
      <p10>A different programming language will require depending on the application platform type. The two most viable options are either using JavaScript for a web-development or .Net Framework to develop it as a window application. It is necessary to reach a sufficient level of programming in order to implement all the features to the application. In addition, the extensive understanding of alphaTab library would be compulsory for an appropriate use. </p10></br</br>
      <p11>The main potential concern of the program after it is published is a copyright and publication issue. Whereas many other tablatures from different apps are mostly uploaded by a copyright owner or a publisher, 	this application would also allow tab uploads from anyone who owns the purchased copy. Therefore, the publisher of the tab notes has a potential of getting disadvantaged. As a solution, the application could be built as an offline application which prohibits any online connections. </p11></br></br>
      <p12>As an ideal outcome, the program would be beneficial for many amateur musicians to learn guitar as well as to enhance their level of performance. Furthermore, the application could expand to other musical instruments to provide a better introduction to beginners and bring better experience in practicing music.</p12></br></br>
